The small production runs for the design ensured that while it remained a popular unit it was never numerous. Most of the Lynx's production run was lost when the Star League fell, but the Not-Named Clan's descendants managed to maintain some of them for their own use and even produced refits of the design, such as the LNX-10R. Armed with two Improved Large Pulse Lasers, two Early Clan-grade ER Medium Lasers, and a standard Medium laser, the -10R is a very dangerous design if left unchecked and can easily decimate its opponents.",
