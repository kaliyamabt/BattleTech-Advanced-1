One such design was captured and returned to the Sanctuary for study, the Crusader. True to the Sanctuary ethos, the Crusader was broken down and rebuilt as a new design with a Sanctuary twist, the Knight. At 70 tons, the Knight weighs more than its progenitor and serves as a heavy battle design. The KNT-2V is a pure fire-support design, built on the same 280-rated XL engine and Endo-Steel frame as the base KNT-2D but carrying a purely VRM-centric loadout of twin VRM-24s and twin VRM-6s. 5 tons of ammo is just barely enough for a regular engagement while several advanced heat negators help keep the heat managed.",
