One such design was captured and returned to the Sanctuary for study, the Crusader. True to the Sanctuary ethos, the Crusader was broken down and rebuilt as a new design with a Sanctuary twist, the Knight. At 70 tons, the Knight weighs more than its progenitor and serves as a heavy battle design. The KNT-3S is built on a 350-rated Sanctuary XL engine and Endo-Steel frame, giving it the speed it needs to bring its 36 DRM tubes into range of the enemy. Once the 5 tons of ammo run dry though, the -3S has nothing to defend itself with, encouraging pilots to be cautious with their shots.",
