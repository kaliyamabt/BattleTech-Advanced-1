The worlds in question include Helen, Errai, Fletcher, Sheratan, and Kawich, all of which have been attacked by Suns forces from the Draconis March. Marshal of the Draconis March, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreJamesSandoval],James Sandoval]], openly declared his intent to take back those worlds from the Hegemony, which he has decried as a corrupt and illegal nation-state that is \"poisoning the heart of the Inner Sphere with their lies\". Director-General [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreChristopherCameron],Christopher Cameron]] has ordered the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTHAF],THAF]] into service to protect their worlds and has also authorized punitive strikes against several Federated Suns worlds as well.",

When the [[DM.Factions[faction_Cameron],Hegemony]] was declared in the late 3030s, it claimed many worlds around the former [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreComStarProtectorate],ComStar Protectorate]] for itself, even taking them by force in some cases which angered the Great Houses whose worlds were being poached. Among those worlds were many from the [[DM.Factions[faction_Davion],Federated Suns]], some of which are the subject of Marshal [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreJamesSandoval],Sandoval]]'s recent attack. However, many of those worlds willingly joined the [[DM.Factions[faction_Cameron],Hegemony]] and had no blood shed over them, making the Marshal's intent unclear. Is he liberating captured worlds from a cruel master or is he taking back what he believes is his despite all evidence to the contrary? It is unclear what the truth is at present.",
